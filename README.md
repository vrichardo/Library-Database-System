# Library-Database-System
## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Database Organization course at the Illinois Institute of Technology during Spring 2023. It was a collaborative effort by our team to design and implement a fully functional library management database system that meets the needs of multiple stakeholders, including librarians, members, and administrators.

The system incorporates core database design principles and applies real-world scenarios to reinforce concepts learned throughout the course.
