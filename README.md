# Library-Database-System
This project was developed for my Database Organization class in Spring 2023 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My team and I designed a library database system to serve various stakeholders.

The project integrated key database concepts learned throughout the semester, including normalization, SQL queries, business rule design, relational schemas, and E-R diagrams.

## documents
Project documentation, including business rules, relational schemas, and E-R diagrams, is available in the **documents** folder. A user guide with instructions on interacting with the database GUI is also included.
